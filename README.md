## Project story
After obtaining a CS degree in mid-2022, I began working on some small Flutter projects that didn't seem to lead anywhere. In November 2022, I decided to follow a promising tutorial that lasted for a day and a half. This was aimed at strengthening my foundational knowledge of Flutter and providing guidance in my learning journey, which included not only Flutter but also good coding practices, Git/Github, Firebase, and other important topics.

[![Learn Flutter in 37 hours](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VPvVD8t02U8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8)

After completing approximately 25 hours of the course, I became enthusiastic about adding new features to the app. A year later, we've reached this point.
 
Not being able to distinguish between a learning project and a real-world project cost me a lot of time in building an application with weak foundations.

Most importantly, I've learned a lot during this year-long project, and I'm confident that I won't repeat the mistakes I've made. However, I would definitely not recommend using a learning project to create a final product.

## Major known issues
The software foundations are inconsistent since started as a tutorial project, and good practices were not developed from the start. This has made the project unsustainable for the long term, mainly because:

#### **State management** 
After a lot of coding, I believed I would finish the project within a few months, I decided that refactoring the existing code would be a waste of time. This turned out to be a poor decision and is the primary reason why the project lacks scalability.

#### **Boilerplate code** 
There is a significant amount of boilerplate code in some critical parts of the project. This is primarily due to the absence of a clear state management system.

#### **Testing** 
No testing beyond using real devices was performed. I realized the importance of testing much later in the project, and by then, it was too late.

## Future of the project
It has been decided that this project is solely for learning purposes, so I will not be updating it beyond fixing bugs or implementing small features in the near future.

If you discover any bugs, please, feel free to report them or help me fix them; otherwise, you are welcome to fork the project, and use it as you please.
