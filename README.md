## Project Story
After obtaining my degree in mid-2022, I began working on some small Flutter projects that didn't seem to lead anywhere. In November 2022, I decided to follow a promising tutorial that lasted for a day and a half. This was aimed at strengthening my foundational knowledge of Flutter and providing guidance in my learning journey, which included not only Flutter but also good coding practices, Git/Github, and Firebase.

[![Learn Flutter in 37 hours](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VPvVD8t02U8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8)

After approximately 25 hours of the course, I became very excited about adding new functionalities to the app, and exactly, after a year, we ended up here.

My initial goal with the tutorial was to take six months, but I ended up learning and adding a lot of things beyond my original plan. 
Not being able to distinguish between a learning project and a real-world project cost me a lot of time in building a project with weak foundations. However, at the end of the day, I am really glad and grateful for what I've accomplished.

Most importantly, I've learned a lot during this year-long project, and I'm confident that I won't repeat the mistakes I've made. However, I would definitely not recommend using a learning project to create a final product.

## Mayor known issues with the project
As the story mentions, this project started as a learning project in 2022. Therefore, the software foundations are inconsistent, and good programming practices were not developed from the start. This has made the project unsustainable for the long term for the following main reasons:

- **State management:** Since after I dropped the tutorial, I believed I would finish the project within a few months, I decided that refactoring the existing code would be a waste of time. Consequently, I continued using stateful widgets and setState. This turned out to be a poor decision and is the primary reason why the project lacks scalability.

- **Boilerplate code:** There is a significant amount of boilerplate code in some of the most critical parts of the project. This is primarily due to the absence of a clear state management system, which did the development more difficult.

- **Testing:** No testing beyond using real devices was performed, mainly because of the issues described in the story and the state management problem. I only realized the importance of testing much later in the project, and by then, it was too late.

## Future of the project
It has been decided that this project is solely for learning purposes, so I will not be updating it beyond fixing bugs or implementing small features in the near future.

If you discover any bugs, please, feel free to report them or help me fix them; otherwise, you are welcome to fork the project, and use it as you please.
