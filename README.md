## Project story
After obtaining a computer science (CS) degree in mid-2022, I began working on some small Flutter projects that didn't seem to lead anywhere. In November 2022, I decided to follow a promising tutorial that lasted for a day and a half. This was aimed at strengthening my foundational knowledge of Flutter.

After completing approximately 25 hours of the course, I became enthusiastic about adding new features to the application. A year later, this is the final result.
 
I wouldn't recommend using a learning project to create a final product.

## Major known issues
The software foundations are inconsistent, making the project unsustainable for the long term.

#### **State management** 
I initially believed I would complete the project within a few months, so I decided that refactoring the existing code to add a solid state management approach would be a waste of time. This turned out to be a poor decision and is the primary reason why the project lacks scalability.

#### **Boilerplate code** 
There is a significant amount of boilerplate code. This is primarily due to the absence of a clear state management system.

#### **Testing** 
No testing beyond using real devices was performed.

#### **Planning**
The project started as a learning project, so it did not have any planning.

## Acknowledgements
This project was a valuable learning experience and it significantly improved my knowledge. I am thankful for the opportunity it provided to enhance my skills.
